A clean, distraction-free, and aesthetic configuration for [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar). Designed to provide essential system information without cluttering your desktop experience.

## 🎨 Features

- **Minimalist Design**: Clean lines and subtle transparency.
- **Essential Modules**:
  - Workspaces (Hyperland/Sway compatible)
  - Clock & Calendar
  - Audio/Volume control
  - Network status
  - Battery indicator
  - System Tray
  - Weather (needs wttrbar)
    ```yay -S wttrbar```
- **Custom Styling**: Refined CSS for a polished look.

## 📦 Requirements

To ensure the icons and modules render correctly, you will need the following:

1.  **Waybar**: The status bar itself.
2.  **Nerd Fonts**: Required for icons.
    - Recommended: [JetBrainsMono Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) (or check `style.css` if a specific font family is defined).
